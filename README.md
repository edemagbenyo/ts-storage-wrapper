# `ts-storage-wrapper`

Storage on in the browser is not so great. `ts-storage-wrapper` gives you super powers.

**Without `ts-storage-wrapper`**:

- ðŸš¨ `.getItem` requires `JSON.parse` to get the item

`ts-storage-wrapper` smooths over these hard edges, just like a CSS reset does in the browser.

**With `ts-storage-wrapper`**:

- âœ… `.getItem` does not requires `JSON.parse` to get the item

## Example

```ts
// Import in a single file, then across your whole project...
import StorageWrapper from "ts-storage-wrapper";


## Get Started

1. Install: `npm i ts-storage-wrapper`



This provides the types you intend and also signals to the developer that this is _slightly_ unsafe.
